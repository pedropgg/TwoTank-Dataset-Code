This repository contains the source code used for data acquisition, real-time control, and technical validation described in the Data Descriptor paper: **"Multi-scenario datasets for system identification and adaptive control of a nonlinear two tank system"**.

This code accompanies the dataset, which captures the dynamics of a nonlinear two-tank system under various regimes, including laminar flow, turbulence (saturation), and abrupt hydraulic faults.

## Data Access
